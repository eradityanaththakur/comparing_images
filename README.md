Image Comparison & Channel Exploration with Python and OpenCV
This project demonstrates how to load, process, and compare two different images using Python, the powerful OpenCV library, and NumPy. We'll specifically explore how to break down images into their color channels and use the XOR (Exclusive OR) operation to find differences between two images. This notebook is great for high school students interested in computer vision and digital image processing!

ðŸš€ What You'll Discover
Load Images: How to bring two images into your Python program.

Size Matching: The importance of making sure both images are the same size for comparison.

Color Channels: Understanding that images are made of Red, Green, and Blue layers.

XOR Operation: A cool trick to highlight where two images are different, pixel by pixel.

Visualize Results: See the original images, their individual color channels, and the XOR difference.
